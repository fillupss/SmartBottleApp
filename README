# AnimalAdventure

The IDE I used to create the project is Intellij and the version of java is SDK 1.8. To run the game 
you may need to set the compiler output and link the "res" folder via the "project structure" -> "modules" -> "dependicies"
then click the "+" button and link "res" folder. This is applicable only for IntelliJ IDE for other IDE it is different configurations.

Also the game may crash sometimes because of a thread exception but it rarely happens.

The controls for my game is:
Player: 
P -> Pause,
W -> Jump,
A -> Left,
D -> Right,
Space -> Shoot,
ESC -> Quit
